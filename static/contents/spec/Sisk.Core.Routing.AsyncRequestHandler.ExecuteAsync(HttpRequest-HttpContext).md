# ExecuteAsync(HttpRequest, HttpContext) method

Declaring type: [Sisk.Core.Routing.AsyncRequestHandler](/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Routing.AsyncRequestHandler.md) (from Sisk.Core)


Definition:

```cs
public abstract Task<HttpResponse?> ExecuteAsync(HttpRequest request, HttpContext context)
```

This method is called by the <a href="/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Routing.Router.md">Router</a> before executing a request when the <a href="/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Routing.Route.md">Route</a> instantiates an object that implements this interface. If it returns a <a href="/read?q=/contents/spec/Sisk.Core.Http.HttpResponse.md">HttpResponse</a> object, the route callback is not called and all execution of the route is stopped. If it returns "null", the execution is continued.
